# FastDIME: Fast and Diverse Model Explanations

This repository provides an implementation of the **FastDIME (Fast and Diverse Model Explanations)** algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations for machine learning models. FastDIME aims to efficiently produce a diverse set of plausible counterfactuals, offering a richer understanding of how to change a model's prediction.

## Overview

Counterfactual explanations are a crucial tool for understanding and interpreting the behavior of machine learning models. They answer the question: "What changes to an input instance would lead to a different prediction?". FastDIME addresses the limitations of some traditional counterfactual generation methods by focusing on:

* **Speed:** Generating counterfactuals efficiently.
* **Diversity:** Providing a set of counterfactuals that explore different ways to achieve the desired outcome.
* **Plausibility:** Considering the realism and actionability of the generated counterfactuals.

This implementation offers a flexible and user-friendly way to apply the FastDIME algorithm to your own machine learning models and datasets.

## Features

- Implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
- Support for image generation and manipulation
- Configurable model architecture and training parameters
